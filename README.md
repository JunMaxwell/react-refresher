# React Learning Projects

This repository is dedicated to keeping track of my React learning projects from Udemy. Here, I will document my progress, share code snippets, and showcase the applications I build while learning React.

Feel free to explore the different projects and provide feedback or suggestions. Let's dive into the world of React together!

## Session 1: React essentials
I'm gonna make this hard to myself by trying to write the code from JS tutorial in TypeScript. Also using Vite instead of Create React App.
To start development server, run
```bash
cd essentials-ts
npm run dev
```
